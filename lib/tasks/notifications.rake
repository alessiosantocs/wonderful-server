  # PROBLEM =======

  # The user signs up
  # Accepts remote notifications and his token is updated
  # Ready to receive notifications

  # The admin creates notifications to be sent daily to users

  # The user will receive 1 notification in the morning at 8am wherever he is
  # He will never receive a notification he has already received

  # SOLUTION =======

  # We have
  # - Users
  # - Notifications
  # - UserNotifications #Â That are basically sent notifications

  # When the user signs up:
  # - Register the timezone of the user

  # A rake task that:
  # - For every user:
  #   - If he did not receive a notification that day
  #     - If it's around 8am depending on his timezone
  #       - Selects a Notification to send from the poll that the user hasn't already received
  #       - Sends it
  #       - Marks in the database the notification as sent
  desc "This task delivers notifications to users when it's time"
